# Week-4-Project-Predict-Employee-Attrition-using-Machine-Learning


Interpretation:

    The most important features influencing attrition include OverTime, JobRole, Age, and MonthlyIncome.
    Employees with lower income and frequent overtime are more likely to leave.
    Using recall as a key metric helps catch employees who are at risk of leaving (minimizing false negatives).

Business Insight:

HR can reduce attrition by:

    Offering flexible hours
    Reviewing compensation structures
    Monitoring high-risk roles
